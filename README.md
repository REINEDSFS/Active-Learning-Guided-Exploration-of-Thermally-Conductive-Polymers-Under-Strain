Abstract
Finding amorphous polymers with higher thermal conductivity (TC) is technologically important, as they are ubiquitous in applications where heat transfer is crucial. While TC is generally low in amorphous polymers, it can be enhanced by mechanical strain, which facilitates the alignment of polymer chains. However, using the conventional Edisonian approach, the discovery of polymers that may have high TC after strain can be time-consuming and without the guarantee of success. In this work, we employ an active learning scheme to speed up the discovery of amorphous polymers with high TC under strain. Polymers under 2x strain are simulated using molecular dynamics (MD), and their TCs are calculated using non-equilibrium MD. A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model is then built using these MD data as the training set. The GPR
